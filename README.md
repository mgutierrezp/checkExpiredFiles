checkExpiredFiles.py
==================================

DESCRIPTION

	You can use this script to set an expiration date to the files of a directory tree.
	The idea is to initialize a config file to store the expiration date of all the files
	under the base directory, and execute the same script periodically to parse the config
	file and delete the expired files/dirs.


REQUIREMENTS

	- Python 2.6 or higher (lower versions may work, but I haven't tested)
	- standard Python modules (have a look to the script header)

INSTALLATION

	No install needed. Simply chmod'it +x and exec


USAGE

	You can obtain some help with -h parameter:

		Usage: checkExpiredFiles.py [options] [-d DIRTOSCAN] -c CONFIGFILE

		  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
		  -d DIRTOSCAN, --directory=DIRTOSCAN
		                        Directory to scan
		  -c CONFIGFILE, --config-file=CONFIGFILE
                		        a text file to read/write meta-information and
		                        configuration
		  -e EXPIRATION, --expiration-date=EXPIRATION
                		        expiration date, expressed as +n (where n=days and
					time is always 22.00) or YYYY/MM/DD_hh:mm. 
					Default +30 days (@22:00)
		  -n, --dry-run         does not perform any update/delete operation
		  -f, --force           force yes to all
		  -v, --verbose         print file list
		  -V, --version         print program version and exit

	The script needs at least one argument to run: the path to the config file.

	So for example if you want to set an expiration date to the directory /foo/bar and
	save the meta-information (expiration date, file names, etc) in /var/configFile, 
	you can run:

		./checkExpiredFiles.py -d /foo/bar -c /var/configFile

	This will create the config file `/var/configFile' which stores the base name to
	scan (/foo/bar) and the information of each file under the directory.
	In subsequents runs, you only have to run:

		./checkExpiredFiles.py -c /var/configFile

	since the directory name to perform the scan is stored within the config file

	If no expiration is specified, it will be set to 30 days later from today, at 22:00.
	The expiration date is set when running the script for the first time or in
	subsequents runs, for new files found. The format is as specified in the help.

	You can use -n option to test what the script would do, or -v option to see
	the list of files the script will find. Please, use them to ensure it will do
	what you want.

	The -f option force all operations (updating, removing, etc.)
